# Hands On - Messaging via API

![line](../assets/banner.png)

Now that we have learned how to authenticate to the Webex API and use a POST request to join a room, lets take it a step further and work with the messaging endpoint to send communication to the room.

## Task 5 - Send Plain Text Message to a Room

1. Open the [Messaging API Documentation](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/messages/create-a-message) and review the documentation for the `POST /messages` endpoint.

2. Notice that the construction is very similar to the "memberships" URL used in the previous task.  However, if we look at the supported fields for the JSON body (payload), we'll see many more options.  Other fields are present, but ones able to fit in the screenshot are shown below.

This brings up a point regarding APIs and documentation; some of the fields that are supported within a JSON body are not only optional, but they can be mutually exclusive.  For example, if you specify a `roomId` in the JSON body, you cannot also specify a `toPersonId` or `toPersonEmail`, as a "room" and a "person" create different kinds of messages (group vs direct/private).  

> Note: The remaining steps have been completed for you in a saved API call within Bruno.  It is recommended that you read through the steps and follow along with the screenshots, but you can skip to the end and run the API call in Bruno if you wish.  The API call is saved as **POST - Send Message to Space | Task 5** in the Bruno collection.

3. Using a similar process to the previous task, create a new POST request that will send a "text" message to the room you just joined.  You'll need to perform the following in any order (with the exception of sending the request)
    - Set the URL to the `POST /messages` endpoint (using the base URL of `https://webexapis.com/v1`)
    - Set the `Authorization` header to the `Bearer` token you gathered from the previous task and pasted in the `personal_token` variable within the collection (this is **not** the bot token)
    - Set the `Content-Type` and `Accept` header to `application/json`
    - Copy and paste the example JSON body from the documentation under the **Request Body (JSON)** tab.  Remove everything except the `roomId` and `text` fields.  The `roomId` value will need to be set to the `{{webex_room}}` variable.  You'll need to change the text to something unique (a Chuck joke, perhaps?)
    - Send the request and verify that the message appears in the room that you were added to in the previous task.

If you're stuck, reference the previous page and the steps we took to join the room.  The process is very similar, but the JSON body and URL are different.  If you're still stuck, ask for help!

## Task 6 - Exporting the Call to the Command Line; Markdown Message

Bruno serves as a great tool for testing and exploring APIs in a way that provides a very low barrier to entry.  One of the other ways that you can use Bruno is to export the request to a command line format.  The export supports not only command-line utilities like `curl`, but also programming languages like Python, Node.js, PHP, and Go (as well as a variety of modules or libraries within those languages).

1. Using the same request that you created in the previous task, click the <img src="./images/postman-code.png" alt="code" width="20" height="18"/> button in the upper right corner of the request window.  This will pop out a window with a variety of options for exporting the request.

2. You can scroll through the variety of options that are available for future reference.  However, we will be using the `Shell-Curl` option for this task.  You can click on the "Copy Snippet" button to copy the command to your clipboard.  This is the overlapping squares in the upper right corner of the code window.

3. Rather than paste this directly into a command line window, we will modify the request to send a **markdown** message and fill in the variables that are not directly exported from the collection.  Open up a new text file in VSCode (or some other plain text editor that you feel comfortable with).  Paste the code into the window and modify it to reflect a `markdown` message, rather than plain text.  You will also need to copy the environment variables out of the collection environment and replace the `{{ }}` variables.  You can use the same message as the previous exercise, but either format or add in some markdown elements.  For example, you could use the following message:

    ```markdown
    **Chuck Norris Joke**
    > Chuck Norris doesn't sleep.  He waits.
    ```

4. When you have the modified request in the file, copy and paste this into a new terminal window and execute the command.  Verify that the message appears in the room and that the markdown is rendered correctly.

**OK.  We've added you to a room and sent a few messages.  Lets challenge you to do all of this on your own via APIs!**
