# Challenge | Combining Webex APIs

![line](../assets/banner.png)

Now that you have experience with the Webex APIs and Postman, lets combine the two endpoints that we have used so far to see how well you can navigate the API documentation.

## What are we doing?

- Create a new room in Webex that you own
- Add in the proctors for this lab to the room, which you find through querying existing rooms
- Send a message to the room to confirm that you have completed the task

## Helpful Hints

- The API endpoint documentation for creating a room is [here](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/rooms/create-a-room)
  - Please use a room name that is unique to you -- like `LTRCRT1100-<your name>`
- The API endpoint documentation for room membership is [here](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/memberships/create-a-membership)
  - You will need to include the ID of the room you created in the previous step.  Because of this, you should either make a new request or copy/paste the ID from the response of the previous request into a new file
  - You can add people to the room by email address or by ID.  Use what makes the most sense to you
- The messaging API endpoint docs have been given.  Post a **markdown** message to the room that includes the proctors via the API

**If you need help, please ask the proctors for assistance.**
