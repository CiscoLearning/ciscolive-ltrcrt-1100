# Challenge | Building A Docker Function for Chuck Norris Jokes

![line](../assets/banner.png)

Now that you have completed all of the tasks related to the handling of Docker images and containers (as well as refreshed some of your knowledge of Bash commands), it is time to combine these skills, along with some of the API and Python knowledge gained from previous sections, to create a Docker function that will return a random Chuck Norris joke and post it to a Webex space.

Rather than requiring you to write everything from scratch, a skeleton Python script and Dockerfile have been provided; you will need to fill in the missing information based on the requirements below.  If at any time you need assistance, the proctors will be able to provide guidance.  Additionally, a completed solution is provided under the `~/ciscolive-ltrcrt-1100/04-docker/code/challenge/solutions` directory.

**Sample code skeletons are in the `~/ciscolive-ltrcrt-1100/04-docker/code/challenge/source` directory.**

## Tasks

- **A**: Move the required files into the container during the build process
- **B**: Install required Python packages into the build container
- **C**: Add in ENV variables to the container at build time
- **D**: Complete the command to execute the Python code when the container is run
- **E**: Add in the ENV variable names based on what is present in the Dockerfile
- **F**: Create the URL for a random Chuck Norris joke
- **G**: Complete the `request` to post the message to the Webex space

> Note: Tasks F, G are more focused on Python.  However, this is done to reinforce fluency within Python, as it is a large component of the DevNet Associate exam.

Once you have the Dockerfile and Python script complete, you will need to build the Docker image and then run the container.  The container should be built with the name `ltrcrt1100-joke` and each build should increment the version tag by 0.1, starting at 0.

During the run process, ensure that the container is cleaned up when the joke has been posted.  You can optionally pass a `--name` flag to the container if you wish.

When complete, verify that the joke has been posted under your name to the shared space.

**Congratulations on completing the Docker portion of LTRCRT1100!**
