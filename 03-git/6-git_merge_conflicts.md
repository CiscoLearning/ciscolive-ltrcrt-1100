![line](../assets/banner.png)

## What are we doing?

- Creating a local branch.
- Committing a change to a file in the **main** branch, using the GitLab web interface.
- Editing the local version of the file, committing the change, and attempting to merge into the **main** branch.
- Fixing the merge conflict.

## Task 11: Commit a New File to a Branch

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, change directory to the cloned git repository if you have not already done so:

```shell
cd ~/learning-git
```
 
2. do something here

Before continuing to the next task, you should have completed the following:

* [x] **Created and checked out a new branch named `dev` from the `main` branch.**
* [x] **Created a new file in the `dev` branch and committed it to the local repository.**
* [x] **Returned to the `main` branch and merged `dev` into `main`.**
* [x] **Pushed the merge commit to the remote GitLab repository.**
* [x] **Verified the new file in the `dev` branch is present in the remote GitLab repository.**

**What happens when a teammate commits and merges changes to the same before you do? Continue to the next set of tasks to learn how to handle *merge conflicts***
