## What are we doing?

In this final portion we will learn how to work with Nested data structures and how to manipulate them.

* A string which is the value of a dictionary name-value pair.
* That dictionary is one element of a list.
* That list is the value of a dictionary name-value pair.
* That dictionary is the value of another dictionary name-value pair.
* That dictionary is the value of yet another dictionary name-value pair.
* That dictionary is the value of one more dictionary name-value pair.


## Task 1: Nested Data

![Nested Data Visualized](images/nested-data.png)

This example seems excessive, but that is precisely the case with the `ip` address in the JSON example we looked at in the previous step.

```JSON
{
    "ietf-interfaces:interface": {
        "name": "GigabitEthernet2",
        "description": "Wide Area Network",
        "enabled": true,
        "ietf-ip:ipv4": {
            "address": [
                {
                    "ip": "172.16.0.2",
                    "netmask": "255.255.255.0"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Indexing Nested Data

> **Reminder:** We access an element within a Python data structure using the square braces `[ ]` and the index of the item we want to "extract." Dictionaries use names as their index, while lists use the numerical index of where each element sits in the ordered sequence (starting at zero).

To index into a nested Python data structure to get to the data element that we want, we start with the outermost data structure and "extract" from it the element that we are interested in, and then repeat the process for each nested data structure.

Let's continue within the Python interpreter and the `json_data` variable you have loaded already.

Now we are extracting the "ietf-interfaces:interface" dictionary from the top-level dictionary in from JSON sample data.

1. Continue within the Python interpreter and the `json_data` variable you have loaded already from previous step. 
try to extract the `ietf-interfaces:interface` dictionary from the top-level dictionary in from JSON sample data.
```bash
pprint(json_data["ietf-interfaces:interface"])
```
2. Now let's print out the `ip` `address` for this interface, we repeat the "extraction process" either mentally or via experimentation in our interactive Python shell, and _**chain the index operations**_ until we have arrived the value that we are seeking.
```bash
json_data["ietf-interfaces:interface"]["ietf-ip:ipv4"]["address"][0]["ip"]
```

### Looping Through Nested Data

> **Reminder:** You can use a `for` loop to iterate through all items in a collection, and to access the items (key-value pairs) in a dictionary, you can use variable unpacking and the dictionary `.items()` method.

3. let's try _Looping through a `list`:_

```bash
rules_list = ["allow", "deny", "delete"]
for rule in rules_list:
    print(rule)
```
4. Now let's try _Looping through a `dictionary`:_

```bash
dc_inventory = {"switches": 5, "routers": 2, "firewalls": 9}
for device, quantity in dc_inventory.items():
    print("You have {} {}.".format(quantity, device))
```

5. Now you can exit out of the Python interpreter and work on a hands-on exercise.

```bash
exit()
```

To loop through nested data, all you need to do is:

1. "Extract" the element that you want to loop through.
2. Use that element as the target of your `for` loop.
3. Within your `for` loop, your loop variable(s) will iteratively be assigned the values of the items within the element you are iterating.

_Example only, needs JSON data to loop through:_

```
for interface in json_data["ietf-interfaces:interfaces"]["interface"]:
    print(interface["name"])
```

## Challenge

Try out looping and indexing nested data with the following coding challenge.

**What you are going to do:**

1. Open the `02-intro-python/code/nested_data.py` file in your editor.
2. Complete the `TODO` steps in the script to:
    1. Parse the contents of the `02-intro-python/code/interfaces.json` JSON file.
    2. Loop through the interfaces in the JSON data.
    3. Print each interface's: name, IP address, and netmask.
3. Run the script in your Terminal to verify your code works.
