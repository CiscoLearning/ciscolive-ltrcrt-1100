# Requests with Meraki API

## What are we doing?
- Now that you have an understanding of how `requests` works, we will do some more challenging tasks with the Meraki API.
- we will pull list of devices from a network and display the information in a pretty table format
- This will require us to use `requests` as well as the python JSON data manipulation skills we learned earlier.
- After this you will do a fun challenge to test your skills. all your own!


## Task 1: Pulling Devices from a Network
1. Use your skills learned so far to understand the API endpoint required to pull the list of devices from a network.
- We need to pull a list of devices from the `Cisco U. Network` network.
- [API endpoint can be found here](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/get-network/)

Hints: 
- API endpoint is `/networks/{networkId}/devices`
- API method is `GET`
- Head over to Postman, build the request and test it out
- Find the information you need to successfully make the API calls here [Meraki API Info](./code/meraki_api_info.md)
- Complete `Steps` in the code found [in meraki_device_report.py](./code/meraki_device_report.py)
- Run the script and see the output
