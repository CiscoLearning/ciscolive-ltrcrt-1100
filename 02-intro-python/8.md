![line](../assets/banner.png)

## What are we doing?
- In this challenge you are provided an organization ID and Access Point Serial Number.
- Your mission is to :
  - Create a new network in the organization
  - Claim the Access Point to the new network
  - Configure the Access Point
  - Deploy a Guest SSID on the Access Point
- You will do this by using the Meraki APIs
  - leverage the **Python requests** library to automate the process


## Challenge Instructions

1. Information you need to complete the challenge can be found in the [Meraki API Info](./code/meraki_api_info.md) document.
- Build your automation script in the [meraki_wireless_deployment.py file.](./code/meraki_wireless_deployment.py)
- You need the `API Key` and `Organization ID` to complete the challenge.
- If you've updated the file from previous tasks **Do Not Use** the `Network ID` from the previous tasks. **We are creating a new network.**
- `Device Serial` number can be found in the [Meraki Serials Info](./code/meraki_serials.md) document.
- Use the `Device Serial` number corresponding to your `Pod Number`.


- *Hint 1* - You are not using `Bruno` for this challenge. You will be using **Python** and the `requests` library.
- *Hint 2* - If you claim your device using `Bruno`, it will error out when you try to claim it using Python. You can only claim a device once.

2. **Create a New Network** in the organization using the Meraki API.
- **[Org Network Endpoint Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/create-organization-network/)**
- Make sure you have the proper `Header` - `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`
- Use the `Organization ID` from the [Meraki API Info](./code/meraki_api_info.md) document.
- Notice the API `Method`
- Body info:
  - `name` : `Pod-<Pod Number>-<Your Name>`
  
***Sample Body - make sure you update the network `name` don't just copy/paste as is :) ***

```JSON
{
    "name": "Pod-<Pod Number>-<Your Name>",
    "productTypes": [
        "wireless"
    ],
    "tags": [ "foo", "bar" ],
    "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "notes": "Creating a new network for Guest wireless"
}
```


3. **Claim the Access Point** to the new network.
- **[Claim Device Endpoint Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/claim-network-devices/)**
- You can find your `Device Serial` number in the [Meraki Serials Info](./code/meraki_serials.md) document.
- Each `POD` has a unique `Device Serial` number. make sure you claim your own device.

***Sample Body***
```JSON
{
    "serials": [
        "YOUR SERIAL HERE"
    ]
}
```


4. **Configure AP** in the new network.
- **[Configure AP Endpoint Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/update-device/)**
- `name` - `<Your Name>-AP`

***Sample Body***
```JSON
{
    "name": "<Your Name Here>-AP",
    "tags": ["recently-added"],
    "address": "500 Terry A Francois Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94158",
    "notes": "This AP will be used for an isolated guest wifi",
    "moveMapMarker": true
}
```

5. **Deploy a Guest SSID** on the Access Point.
- **[Deploy SSID Endpoint Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/update-network-wireless-ssid/)**

***Use the following Body***
```JSON
{
      "number": 0,
      "name": "Guest WiFi",
      "enabled": true,
      "splashPage": "None",
      "ssidAdminAccessible": false,
      "radiusAccountingEnabled": false
}
```

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the challenge.

Stuck? but first attempt it yourself, it's the best way to learn.
