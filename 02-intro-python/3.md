## What are we doing?

you will start learning the needed Python structures.
After this task, you will have hands-on experience with:
- Python structure
- Conditionals
- `while` and `for` loops
- Functions

## Task 1 - Python structure

Python has no firm requirements on how to structure your scripts/programs. Since there are no requirements on structure, you have flexibility in the way your code ultimately looks and operates. However, there are python standard recommendations in place to ensure that best practices are followed.

> Check out the [PEP8] (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide!

The only firm requirement for execution and structure is **indentation**. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code and how those blocks are executed. You will see next in conditionals how important the correct indentation is in Python.

## Task 2 - Conditionals

Conditionals, also known as compound statements are used to build if/then/else logic models for statement execution.

Python `if` conditional blocks are executed in a top down fashion. If a condition is met the remainder of checks are **skipped**.

<details>
<summary><strong>Using the <code>if</code> syntax</strong></summary>

```
if expression1:
    statement
elif expression2:
    statement
else:
    statement
```

> **Note**: Pay attention to the indentation - it defines the block to be executed when a condition is met.

The above `if` conditional block: 

1. If `expression1` is `True`, execute the statement inside of the local block. 
2. Else if `expression2` is `True`, execute the statement inside of the local block. 
3. Else execute the final statement

<details><summary><strong>Comparison operators and logical expressions</strong></summary>


| Comparison Operator | Meaning                  |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------|
| `<`                   | Less Than                |
| `>`                   | Greater Than             |
| `<=`                  | Less Than or Equal To    |
| `>=`                  | Greater Than or Equal To |
| `==`                  | Equal To                 |
| `!=`                  | Not Equal To             |
| `in`                  | Contains Element         |

You can combine expressions with `and` or `or`. Negate an expression with `not`.

1. Activate the interactive Python shell.
```bash
python3 -i
```
2. Create a `device_details` dictionary with hostname, sw_version, alerts, and a list of interfaces.
```bash
device_details = {"hostname": "sw1", "sw_version": 20.4, "alerts": False, "interfaces": ["GigabitEthernet 1", "GigabitEthernet 2", "GigabitEthernet 3"]}
```
3. Print out the `device_details`.
```bash
print(device_details)
```

Expected output:
```
{'hostname': 'sw1', 'sw_version': 20.4, 'alerts': False, 'interfaces': ['GigabitEthernet 1', 'GigabitEthernet 2', 'GigabitEthernet 3']}
```

4. Create an `if` conditional that prints a message if `device_details["alerts"]` is `True`. `else` print some other message.
    > **Note**: After a multiline statement, such as the conditional below, the Python interactive shell requires you to hit enter again to execute the lines. This might not happen automatically in this learning lab environment.

```bash
if device_details["alerts"]:
  print("There are alerts on the device!")
else:
  print("No alerts on the device")

```

    Expected output:
    ```
    No alerts on the device
    ```

5. Create another `if` conditional that prints one message `if` "GigabitEthernet 2" is `in` the list `device_details["interfaces"]`, and another message `elif` (else if) "GigabitEthernet 3" is `in` the list `device_details["interfaces"]`.

```bash
if "GigabitEthernet 2" in device_details["interfaces"]:
  print("There is an interface GigabitEthernet 2 on the device!")
elif "GigabitEthernet 3" in device_details["interfaces"]:
  print("There is an interface GigabitEthernet 3 on the device!")

```

Expected output:
```
There is an interface GigabitEthernet 2 on the device!
```

Why was the GigabitEthernet 3 message not printed out even though the interface is in the list?

## Task 3: Loops

Loops allow you to execute certain code block for a defined duration. Most often you would use a `for` loop to iterate through a list of items such as the interfaces of a switch, and `while` when waiting for some condition be met, such as a test result to be available in ThousandEyes.

<details><summary><strong>Using Loops</strong></summary> 

A **`for`** loop iterates through a sequence or collection, essentially taking one item at a time and running the block of statements until all items have been iterated through.

```
for individual_item in iterator:
    statements…
```

Conditional loop **`while`** evaluates an expression before each iteration of the loop. If the expression evaluates to `True`, the loop statements are executed. If the expression evaluates to `False`, the loop statements are not executed and the script continues with the first line after the loop block.

```
while expression:
    statements…
```

You can manually break out of both of these loops from within the code block by using the keyword `break`.

```
for interface in interfaces:
    if "default gateway" in interface["description"]:
        print("Default gateway found!")
        break
```

You can manually jump to the next round of the loop from within the code block by using the keyword `continue`.

```
for interface in interfaces:
    if not interface["enabled"]:
        print("Interface not enabled... continuing to the next interface")
        continue
```

<hr>
</details>

1. Continue working in the interactive Python shell, and print out one by one all the interfaces in the `device_details["interfaces"]` list.
    ```bash
    for interface in device_details["interfaces"]:
        print(interface)

    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    GigabitEthernet 1
    GigabitEthernet 2
    GigabitEthernet 3
    ```

2. Use the `while` loop to ask the user if ThousandEyes test results are available, and keep printing "ThousandEyes test results not available yet" until the user provides input "yes".
    ```bash
    while True:
        tests_available = input("Are ThousandEyes test results available? ")
        if tests_available == "yes":
            print("Tests are available, breaking away from while loop!")
            break
        else:
            print("ThousandEyes test results not available yet")
    
    ```

    > **Note**: Function `input("my question")` gathers data from a user via stdin.

    > **Note**: Python is case-sensitive - if you wanted to allow the user to provide "yes" with uppercase letters, you could use the `.lower()` method to convert the input to lowercase before comparing in the conditional: `if tests_available.lower() == "yes":`

3. Before continuing, exit the interactive Python shell.
    ```bash
    exit()
    ```
   
## Task 4: Functions

Find yourself writing blocks of identical or nearly identical code in several places throughout your script (or in several of your scripts)? It's time to create a function. Functions let you write a piece of code once, give it a name, and then call that piece of code whenever you need it. They can (optionally) accept input arguments and return output that enables you to create operations that take input and return output according to your needs.

_You can also define default values for arguments by assigning them in the function definition, like `def greet(name="Guest"):`._

```
def function_name(arg_1, arg_2):
    statements...
    return value
```

1. Activate the Python interactive shell.

```bash
python3 -i
```

2. Create a function that doesn't require any arguments or return any values.

```bash
def hello_world():
  print("Hello world!")
```

3. Call your function and see the message printed out.

```bash
hello_world()
```

4. Create a function that takes an argument, and returns a value.

```bash
def add(num1, num2):
  result = num1 + num2
  return result
```

5. Call the new function with two numbers and print the output.

```bash
print(add(3,4))
```

Expected output:

```
7
```

## Task 5: Importing Modules

You can also use external libraries and modules. These are functions and classes residing outside of your script - importing them in allows you to use code created by others, or reuse your own existing script functionalities.

- **Standard libraries**: Python comes with many useful standard libraries inbuilt. You can see all the available libraries in [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). You can directly import standard library in your script without other actions needed.
    ```
    import time
    time.sleep(30) # sleeping 30 seconds
    ```
- **Community developed libraries** can be installed from [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). These 3rd party libraries can be installed with the Python tool `pip`. 
    ```
    $ pip install requests
    $ python3 -i
    >>> import requests
    ```
- **Self-made modules** such as yor own classes and functions in other Python files can be imported as well. This allows you to create modular code, where different functionalities are defined in different Python files. 
    - When defining your own modules, note that all the global level code will be included when the code is imported. However, you can easily define which part of the code should be executed *only* if you run the script directly and therefor should not be included when importing the code. Whenever script is ran directly (such as what you do when writing `python my_file.py` on your terminal), Python defines a variable `__name__` with a value `"__main__"`. A good practice to un-include unnecessary global level code when importing is to define that under an `if` statement:
        ```
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("This print statement will not be executed when this script is imported")
        ```

**Virtual environments** are a way to contain your development environment and isolate the python interpreter, 3rd party modules/libraries and configurations. At first, they may seem unnecessary but as you progress through your python journey they will becomes critical to a clean working system. A virtual environment can be: 
- created with command `python -m venv <virtual environment name>`
- activated in Linux based environment with command `source <virtual environment name>/bin/activate`
- deactivate in Linux based environment with command `deactivate`

<hr>

1. In the interactive Python shell, experiment with the Python standard library `time`. Start by importing the library.
```bash
import time
```

2. Now the library functionalities, such as the `sleep` method are available for you. To experiment, create a `for` loop that prints numbers, taking a 5 second break in between every number.
```bash
for number in [1,2,3,4]:
  print(number)
  time.sleep(5)
```

> **Note**: When using functionalities from an imported module, note the syntax: `<module_name>.<function_name>`. The `time` is the namespace of `sleep` and makes it clear for you to understand where the function is defined, but also prevents you from accidentally overwriting the `sleep` function. It is possible to import a functionality also directly `from time import sleep`, in which case you would refer to the imported functionality without the module's name.

3. Exit the interactive Python shell to create a virtual environment.
```bash
exit()
```
4. Create a new virtual environment with the name "testdrive".
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment.
 ```bash
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```

6. Install library `requests` which allows you to make HTTP requests through Python.
 ```bash
 pip install requests
 ```

7. You may verify that `requests` is indeed installed with `pip list`.
 ```bash
 pip list
 ```
8. Activate the Python interactive shell.
 ```bash
 python3 -i
 ```
9. Import the `requests` library.
 ```bash
 import requests
 ```
10. Now you can start using the functionalities of requests library! Try the following API call which returns your public IP address, and print out the response!
 ```bash
 ip = requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text
 print(f'My public IP address is: {ip}')
 ```

11. Before continuing, exit the interactive Python shell and deactivate the virtual environment.
 ```bash
 exit()
 ```

 ```bash
 deactivate
 ```
