## What are we doing?

you will start to learn how to parse JSON text into native Python data and how to work with results. 
Python takes care of the hard part and you get to reap all the benefits.
The majority of the APIs we work with will return data in JSON format.
We will learn how to read and manipulate this data.

- The need for structured data formats.
- How to read-from and write-to files using Python.
- JSON’s lightweight syntax.
- How to use Python’s JSON module to “load” and “dump” data.
- How to access data elements within nested data.

## Task 1: Reading and writing files

Reading from and writing to text files is easy with Python's built-in `open()` function.

Open your Python interactive shell:

1. Open the python interpreter:

```bash
python -i
```

2. Open the file `./02-intro-python/code/pep20.txt` for reading.

```bash
file = open('./02-intro-python/code/pep20.txt', mode='r')
```
3. Read and print the contents of the file.

```bash
file_contents = file.read()
print(file_contents)
```
Close the file.

```bash
file.close()
```

### Open function

Here are some excerpts from the [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) that help to explain `file` and `mode`:

```bash
open(file, mode='r')
```

This code opens `file` and returns a corresponding [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object). If the file cannot be opened, an [OSError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError) is raised.

* `file` is a [path-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) object that provides the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened.

* `mode` is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to `r`, which means "open for reading in text mode". Another common value is `w` for writing (truncating the file if it exists).

> **Note:** Don't forget to `.close()` files that you open. If you don't want to have to remember to close the files, use the `with` statement and let it manage the context for your open file.

### The `with` statement

Python provides an "under the hood" context manager capability that is powerful and easy to understand. In this context, we want to open a file, work with its contents, and have Python remember to close it. We use the `with` statement to instruct Python to do follow these steps.

This example does the same thing that we did in the last example. However, this time we don't have to remember to `.close()` the file when we are done with it, and it only reads the first line:

4. Try the `with` statement in your `python -i`:

```bash
with open('./02-intro-python/code/pep20.txt', mode='r') as file:
     file_firstline = file.readline()
     print(file_firstline)
```

Output:

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
```

The `with` statement instructs Python to follow these steps:

- `with` the (_file_object_ returned from the `open()` function) assigned to the variable name `file`:
- Perform the indented block of statements.
- Close the file when we are done with the indented block.

### Writing files
Writing to a file is the same as reading from one. We open the file in "writing" mode with the `open(file, mode='w')` function. Then, we use the `file.write()` function to write our contents to the file.

### Exit the interpreter

You can exit out of the Python interpreter now:

```bash
exit()
```

Clear your terminal, too:
```bash
clear
```

Now that we know how to read and write some text to files in our file system, let's learn how to work with JSON.

## Task 2: Parsing JSON
## What is JSON?

JSON stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_. It is a standardized format that is uses name-value pairs to exchange data as structured text, and is compatible with many applications and programming languages.

>**Note**: You don't have to know any JavaScript to use and understand JSON data.

Look at the following JSON example:

```JSON
{
    "ietf-interfaces:interface": {
        "name": "GigabitEthernet2",
        "description": "Wide Area Network",
        "enabled": true,
        "ietf-ip:ipv4": {
            "address": [
                {
                    "ip": "172.16.0.2",
                    "netmask": "255.255.255.0"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

JSON syntax is almost identical to the syntax that Python's built-in data structures uses. However, there are a few important differences. 

* **Single vs. double quotes**: Python accepts both, but JSON strings must be delineated with double quotes `" "`.
* **Capitalized boolean value**: Python uses `True` with a capital `T` and `False` with a capital `F`. JSON conventions use all-lowercase `true` and `false`.
* **Trailing commas**: Python ignores any trailing commas. JSON does not ignore them and returns errors if you accidentally leave trailing commas in your JSON data.

### Using the Python `json` module

The [`json` module in the Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) contains encoding and decoding functions that do the hard work of parsing and working with JSON data.

The module's load-from-string `json.loads()` function parses JSON text that is contained within a string and returns the Python-native data structures.

The module's dump-to-string `json.dumps()` function takes Python-native data structures and attempts to convert them into a JSON string. It can even make the JSON human-friendly, if you pass it the argument `indent=4`.

> **Note:** Not all Python data structures can be parsed into JSON notation. For example, if you create your own class, Python cannot know how to represent objects created from your class in JSON format. The best practice is to use with Python's built-in data structures (`dict`, `list`, and so on) when you want your data to be able to be encoded as JSON text.

1. Let's parse a JSON file into Python dictionary structures.
```bash
cd 02-intro-python/code
python3 parsing_json.py
```
Sweet! now let's look at what we actually did in the code.

2. Start the python interpreter:

```bash
python3 -i
```

3. Import the modules and functionality that we want to use in our script at the top of our Python file:

```bash
import json
import os
from pprint import pprint
```
4. Locate the full path of the directory where this script resides. Store the directory path in the variable `here`.

```bash
# Get the absolute path for the directory where this file is located "here"
here = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname("interface-config.json"))
```

5. Use the full path for "here" to open and read-in the contents of the JSON file `interface-config.json` into the variable named `json_text`.

```bash
# Read in the JSON text
with open(os.path.join(here, "interface-config.json")) as file:
    json_text = file.read()
    
```

6. Pretty-print the type of the `json_data` variable. Are you surprised by the type this time? 

```bash
# Display the type of the json_data variable
print("json_data is a", type(json_text))
```

7. Pretty-print the contents of the `json_text` variable. Extra indentation makes it much easier to read than all-on-one-line.

```bash
# Display the contents of the json_data variable
pprint(json_text)
```


Next we look into getting pieces of that nested JSON data. It's logical once you look, and sometimes it helps to create a diagram of it. 

> **Note**: Don't exit the Python interpreter yet. You must use the `json_text` and `json_data` variables in the interpreter in the next section.
